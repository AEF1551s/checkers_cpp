# checkers_cpp  
## Goal:   
Make AI based on game tree and min-max alpha-beta pruning.  
## GUI:  
Uses SDL library.  
## Basic working principle: This consists of 2 layers:  
* GUI layer records inputs and generates graphics based on game state.  * Game logic level changes game state based on inputs, passes game state to AI class for further use.    
## TODO: 
### 1. The full game tree is not generated, only seperated branches, based on start state.  
### 2. Implement Alpha-Beta pruning.  
## Install/run  
To compile this on Linux/Windows based systems, install SDL library based on official instructions.
